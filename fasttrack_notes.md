# Introduction
- (https://repl.it/@eponsonby/dc-fasttrack)
- `puts` is the same as `console.log`
- `nil` is Ruby's word for nothing, or empty. There's nothing there (explore this concept more)
- use a single # to write a comment in Ruby
-  REPL stands for Read Eval Print Loop. It is an interactive computer programming environment that takes user inputs, evaluates them, and returns the result to the user
- Gems are Ruby libraries
- in Ruby, you don't have to declare a variable with var or const. You just use the variable name
``` ruby
result = 40 *10
puts result
```
- In the above code, Ruby evaluates the code to the right of the variable and then stores the result in the variable
- `5.to_s` converts the number 5 to a string. 5 could also be a variable name
- `.to_i` converts to an integer
- Method arguments, or parameters
- run `learn --fail-fast` to get the first errror
- `variable_name.split` splits a string into an array
- `variable_name.join` joins an array into a string
