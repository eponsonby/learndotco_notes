# Object Oriented Ruby
## Object Models
### Remembering objects
* an @@ before a variable name indicates a class variable, like this: @@class_variable
* Class variables can be used to keep track of every instance the class creates
* To define a class method we use the `def self.method_name` syntax
* The self in this example is a reminder that the method will not be called on a particular instance of the class but rather the class itself
